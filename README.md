# Blackscale-Sabaac
## Introduction

Sabacc is a gambling card game played in the Star Wars Universe. It is a difficult game to adapt to real-world play because it uses an electronic deck of cards that can switch values at random. What’s more, the deck is composed of 76 cards, in the following configuration:

    Four Suits (Sabers, Flasks, Coins, Staves)
        Values 1 - 11
        Ranked Cards
            Commander (value 12)
            Mistress (value 13)
            Master (value 14)
            Ace (value 15)

    Two copies of eight Face Cards
        The Star (value -17)
        The Evil One (value -15)
        Moderation (value -14)
        Demise (value -13)
        Balance (value -11)
        Endurance (value -8)
        Queen of Air and Darkness (value -2)
        Idiot (value 0) 

    NB. In this game, each suit has both an "ace" (value 15) and a "one" (value 1)!

## Star Wars Universe Rules Overview

The game is typically played by 4 to 6 beings, and is rarely played with more than eight participants. Most casino games are dealt by a droid dealer. This droid also controls the random pulses that change the values of the cards. It is this randomness that adds much of the suspense to the game. A winning hand can very quickly become a devastatingly losing hand. All hands are figured based on the numerical sum of the card values.

Sabacc’s main objective is to win Credits. There are two pots, the Main Pot and the Sabacc Pot, to be won in Sabacc. Each hand starts with each player placing an ante into both the Main Pot and the Sabacc Pot. Subsequent bets during the hand will be placed only into the Main Pot.

The dealer then deals out two cards, one at a time, to each player. Depending on the casino or the participants, it may be required for every player to call out their beginning hand totals. Players then take turns drawing a card, trading a card, or standing. Afterwards a betting round proceeds where players can call, raise, and bluff. The first through fourth rounds of play and betting are usually considered the pot-building phase, and the game cannot be Called during this time.

The hand ends when a player (after the pot-building phase) declares they would like to Call the hand. One last round of betting occurs, starting with the Calling player, and then players reveal their cards. Winning hands in Sabacc are hands that total 23 or -23, which are called Pure Sabacc, or a hand made up of an Idiot (value 0) a 2 of any suit and a 3 of any suit (this is a literal 023) called an Idiot’s Array. An Idiot’s Array beats a Pure Sabacc. If no one has any of these winning hands, the player with the highest hand total below 23 wins. Any player with a hand totaling more than 23, less than -23, or exactly 0 at the time the hand is called has Bombed Out. The penalty for Bombing Out is to pay an amount equal to the contents of the Main Pot into the Sabacc Pot. The winning player takes the contents of the Main Pot. If that player won with a Pure Sabacc or an Idiot’s Array, the Sabacc Pot is also collected.

In the event that two or more players have equal winning hands, a Sudden Demise is enacted between those players. Each player in the Sudden Demise is dealt one extra card. Their hand totals are then re-summed to include their new card. Whichever player then has the best modified hand wins. If all players involved in the Sudden Demise bomb out they do not have to pay into the Sabacc pot, but none are then eligible to win the Main Pot. The Main Pot in that case goes to the player with the best hand who is not bombed out.

At any time during game-play, up until the point where players reveal their cards, a Sabacc Shift may occur. It is the rare case when a Sabacc Shift occurs three or more times in a single hand, though once should be expected and twice is not abnormal. This random event is set in motion by a pulse from the droid-dealer and redistributes the values of the cards. The only way to prevent a card from being effected by the Shift is to place it in the Static (or Disruptor) Field. This Field disrupts and blocks the Shift pulse and locks the values of all cards placed within it. The trade-off for placing a card in the Field is that it is placed face-up and the value can be seen by all other players.
